# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning

My senior project involves developing a CNN model to classify Diabetic Retinopathy stages using fundus images from the EYEPACS dataset. 
I am optimizing model performance through image preprocessing and experimentation with various CNN architectures,
including EfficientNetB7 and InceptionV3. The project is currently in progress.
